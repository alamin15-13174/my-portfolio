        <h2>Dream big to be a good man</h2>
        <p>This gritty portrayal of art through adversity picks up where the author left us in Train of Thought; Poems from the Red Line. The book begins in Kendall Square, the home of M.I.T; moves on to Central Square, the land of the Out of the Blue Gallery, The Middle East, and once T.T the Bears; on to Harvard with the Hahvad Punk kids; and exits at the home of famed Johnny Dâ€™s, Davis Square. Join a poet with time to kill on the MBTA, with his worst enemy, his mind, and his best friend, the pen.
